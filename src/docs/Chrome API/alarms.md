# chrome.alarms

>[!IMPORTANT]
> *Chrome 120*: Starting in Chrome 120, the minimum alarm interval has been reduced from 1 minute to 30 seconds. For an alarm to trigger in 30 seconds, set periodInMinutes: 0.5.
> *Chrome 117*: Starting in Chrome 117, the number of active alarms is limited to 500. Once this limit is reached, chrome.alarms.create() will fail. When using a callback, chrome.runtime.lastError will be set. When using promises, the promise will be rejected.

Use the `chrome.alarms` API to schedule code to run periodically or at a specified time in the future.

## Permissions

- `alarms`

To use the `chrome.alarms` API, declare the "`alarms`" permission in the manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "alarms"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Concepts and usage
To ensure reliable behavior, it is helpful to understand how the API behaves.

### Device sleep
Alarms continue to run while a device is sleeping. However, an alarm will not wake up a device. When the device wakes up, any missed alarms will fire. Repeating alarms will fire at most once and then be rescheduled using the specified period starting from when the device wakes, not taking into account any time that has already elapsed since the alarm was originally set to run.

### Persistence
Alarms generally persist until an extension is updated. However, this is not guaranteed, and alarms may be cleared when the browser is restarted. Consequently, consider setting a value in storage when an alarm is created, and then ensure it exists each time your service worker starts up. For example:

```js
const STORAGE_KEY = "user-preference-alarm-enabled";

async function checkAlarmState() {
  const { alarmEnabled } = await chrome.storage.get(STORAGE_KEY);

  if (alarmEnabled) {
    const alarm = await chrome.alarms.get("my-alarm");

    if (!alarm) {
      await chrome.alarms.create({ periodInMinutes: 1 });
    }
  }
}

checkAlarmState();
```
## Examples
The following examples show how to use and respond to an alarm. To try this API, install the Alarm API example from the chrome-extension-samples repository.

### Set an alarm
The following example sets an alarm in the service worker when the extension is installed:

```js
// service-worker.js
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(async ({ reason }) => {
  if (reason !== 'install') {
    return;
  }

  // Create an alarm so we have something to look at in the demo
  await chrome.alarms.create('demo-default-alarm', {
    delayInMinutes: 1,
    periodInMinutes: 1
  });
});
```
### Respond to an alarm
The following example sets the action toolbar icon based on the name of the alarm that went off.

```js
// service-worker.js
chrome.alarms.onAlarm.addListener((alarm) => {
  chrome.action.setIcon({
    path: getIconPath(alarm.name),
  });
});
```

## Types
### Alarm
#### Properties
- name
`string`

Name of this alarm.

- periodInMinutes
`number` optional

If not null, the alarm is a repeating alarm and will fire again in periodInMinutes minutes.

- scheduledTime
`number`

Time at which this alarm was scheduled to fire, in milliseconds past the epoch (e.g. Date.now() + n). For performance reasons, the alarm may have been delayed an arbitrary amount beyond this.

### AlarmCreateInfo
#### Properties
- delayInMinutes
`number` optional

Length of time in minutes after which the onAlarm event should fire.

- periodInMinutes
`number` optional

If set, the onAlarm event should fire every periodInMinutes minutes after the initial event specified by when or delayInMinutes. If not set, the alarm will only fire once.

- when
`number` optional

Time at which the alarm should fire, in milliseconds past the epoch (e.g. Date.now() + n).

## Methods
### clear()
`Promise`

```js
chrome.alarms.clear(
  name?: string,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Clears the alarm with the given name.

#### Parameters
- name
`string` optional

The name of the alarm to clear. Defaults to the empty string.

- callback
`function` optional

The `callback` parameter looks like:

```js
(wasCleared: boolean) => void
```

- wasCleared
`boolean`

#### Returns
`Promise<boolean>`

Chrome 91+
Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### clearAll()
`Promise`

```js
chrome.alarms.clearAll(
  callback?: function,
)
```

Clears all alarms.

#### Parameters
- callback
`function` optional

The `callback` parameter looks like:

```js
(wasCleared: boolean) => void
```

- wasCleared
`boolean`

#### Returns
`Promise<boolean>`

Chrome 91+
Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### create()
`Promise`

```js
chrome.alarms.create(
  name?: string,
  alarmInfo: AlarmCreateInfo,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Creates an alarm. Near the time(s) specified by `alarmInfo`, the onAlarm event is fired. If there is another alarm with the same name (or no name if none is specified), it will be cancelled and replaced by this alarm.

In order to reduce the load on the user's machine, Chrome limits alarms to at most once every 30 seconds but may delay them an arbitrary amount more. That is, setting `delayInMinutes` or `periodInMinutes` to less than `0.5` will not be honored and will cause a warning. `when` can be set to less than 30 seconds after "now" without warning but won't actually cause the alarm to fire for at least 30 seconds.

To help you debug your app or extension, when you've loaded it unpacked, there's no limit to how often the alarm can fire.

#### Parameters
- name
`string` optional

Optional name to identify this alarm. Defaults to the empty string.

- alarmInfo
`AlarmCreateInfo`

Describes when the alarm should fire. The initial time must be specified by either `when` or `delayInMinutes` (but not both). If `periodInMinutes` is set, the alarm will repeat every `periodInMinutes` minutes after the initial event. If neither `when` or `delayInMinutes` is set for a repeating alarm, `periodInMinutes` is used as the default for `delayInMinutes`.

- callback
`function` optional

Chrome 111+
The `callback` parameter looks like:

```js
() => void
```

#### Returns
`Promise<void>`

Chrome 111+
Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### get()
`Promise`

```js
chrome.alarms.get(
  name?: string,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Retrieves details about the specified alarm.

#### Parameters
- name
`string` optional

The name of the alarm to get. Defaults to the empty string.

- callback
`function` optional

The `callback` parameter looks like:

```js
(alarm?: Alarm) => void
```

- alarm
`Alarm` optional

#### Returns
`Promise<Alarm | undefined>`

Chrome 91+
Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### getAll()
`Promise`

```js
chrome.alarms.getAll(
  callback?: function,
)
```

Gets an array of all the alarms.

#### Parameters
- callback
`function` optional

The `callback` parameter looks like:

```js
(alarms: Alarm[]) => void
```

- alarms
`Alarm[]`

#### Returns
`Promise<Alarm[]>`

Chrome 91+
Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

```

Fired when an alarm has elapsed. Useful for event pages.

#### Parameters
- callback
`function`

The `callback` parameter looks like:

```js
