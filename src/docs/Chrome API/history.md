# chrome.history

Use the `chrome.history` API to interact with the browser's record of visited pages. You can add, remove, and query for URLs in the browser's history. To override the history page with your own version, see Override Pages.

## Permissions

- `history`

To interact with the user's browser history, use the history API.

To use the history API, declare the "history" permission in the extension manifest. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": ["history"]
}
```

## Concepts and usage

### Transition types

The history API uses transition types to describe how the browser navigated to a particular URL on a particular visit. For example, if a user visits a page by clicking a link on another page, the transition type is "link". See the reference content for a list of transition types.

## Examples

To try this API, install the [history API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/history) from the chrome-extension-samples repository.

## Types
### HistoryItem

An object encapsulating one result of a history query.

### Properties

#### id
string

The unique identifier for the item.

#### lastVisitTime
number optional

When this page was last loaded, represented in milliseconds since the epoch.

#### title
string optional

The title of the page when it was last loaded.

#### typedCount
number optional

The number of times the user has navigated to this page by typing in the address.

#### url
string optional

The URL navigated to by a user.

####visitCount
number optional

The number of times the user has navigated to this page.

## TransitionType
Chrome 44+
The transition type for this visit from its referrer.

### Enum

- `link`: The user arrived at this page by clicking a link on another page.
- `typed`: The user arrived at this page by typing the URL in the address bar. This is also used for other explicit navigation actions.
- `auto_bookmark`: The user arrived at this page through a suggestion in the UI, for example, through a menu item.
- `auto_subframe`: The user arrived at this page through subframe navigation that they didn't request, such as through an ad loading in a frame on the previous page. These don't always generate new navigation entries in the back and forward menus.
- `manual_subframe`: The user arrived at this page by selecting something in a subframe.
- `generated`: The user arrived at this page by typing in the address bar and selecting an entry that didn't look like a URL, such as a Google Search suggestion. For example, a match might have the URL of a Google Search result page, but it might appear to the user as "Search Google for ...". These are different from typed navigations because the user didn't type or see the destination URL. They're also related to keyword navigations.
- `auto_toplevel`: The page was specified in the command line or is the start page.
- `form_submit`: The user arrived at this page by filling out values in a form and submitting the form. Not all form submissions use this transition type.
- `reload`: The user reloaded the page, either by clicking the reload button or by pressing Enter in the address bar. Session restore and Reopen closed tab also use this transition type.
- `keyword`: The URL for this page was generated from a replaceable keyword other than the default search provider.
- `keyword_generated`: Corresponds to a visit generated for a keyword.
